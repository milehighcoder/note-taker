## Description

I modified starter code to create an application called "Note Taker" that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an Express.js backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end was provided. My job was to simply build the backend, connect it with the front end, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
